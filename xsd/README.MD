This is the directory where most xsd used are stored. They are ready to be referenced through https://owe.glease.net/ domain.

Currently, there are two files avalible:

* [resources_1.0.xsd](/xsd/resources_1.0.xsd) https://owe.glease.net/xsd/resource_1.0.xsd
* [log4j2-config.xsd](/xsd/log4j2-config.xsd) https://owe.glease.net/xsd/log4j2-config.xsd

The log4j2-config.xsd is extracted from log4j-core 2.7 jar file and is copyrighted by ASF and/or its contributors. I'm poor with law, if I violated some license please open an issue and I'll correct it ASAP.
